Hi! I'm still working on our general information but this is a progress from the previous WIP site :) As you see github.com still remain as a preference.<br>

In addition to new WIP site,  I'm catching up on blogging with Jekyl.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><br> 
Things can always be more complicated so before I produce anything I’d like to make it meaningful. I’m re-reading some interesting blogs to produce a meaningful content in least words possible.

<p> Based on the DB's I'm working with now, focus will be open source. Flavor of choice will remain PostgreSQL and MySQL but I'll work to include some of the other types of data store like ElasticSearch, SolR and whatever interesting I stumble upon.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf --> <br>

<p> Feel free to see what we are working here: <a href="https://github.com/ubfm?tab=repositories">@ubfm</a> <br> 

I’ll include twitter in the following days in case I do not opt out for something open sourced
